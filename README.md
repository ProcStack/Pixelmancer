# Pixelmancer
Canvas and other transform scripts from Pxlmancer.com

Pixelmancer is a large Javascript / CSS / HTML5 / Canvas script base.  While I'm not going to upload the entire script base under GNU (It is a website, you can dig through it if you wish), this is where you can find functions writen with specific uses.

For any web developement outside of Pxlmancer function, they can be found in the Web Dev respository.
Like any webGl developement and class oriented javascript tests.
